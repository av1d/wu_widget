You only need to skin the following:

0-9
F, C
blank
colon, negative
dim_full.png
background.png

Any other images in the classic skin folder are currently unused.
You could use "blank.png" to display a graphic if you wanted instead of a space 
(try the gadget skin, for example).
You can also use template.xcf or digits.xcf in Gimp to create your own templates.

Tip: you can use the background.png and just copy it to dim_full.png as well, or
vice versa. You can also simply just create background images and use existing fonts.
Check the backgrounds directory for some random backgrounds.

How to edit digit colors super fast:
  load digits.xcf
  Perform whatever edit you want to the first layer.
  Click the next layer, press CTRL+F to repeat the action quickly.
  Do this for all layers.
  Now make all layers invisible except the first (click the eye).
  Go to the first layer, press SHIFT+CTRL+E to export it.
  Now make that layer invisible and the next visible.
  Rinse, repeat until all are exported.
